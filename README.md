Fertilizers Recommendation System For Disease Prediction
Agriculture is the main aspect of country development. Many people lead their life from agriculture field, which gives fully related to agricultural
products. Plant disease, especially on leaves, is one of the major factors of reductions in both quality and quantity of the food crops. In agricultural
aspects, if the plant is affected by leaf disease then it reduces the growth of the agricultural level. Finding the leaf disease is an important role of
agriculture preservation. After pre-processing using a median filter, segmentation is done by Guided Active Contour method and finally, the leaf disease
is identified by using Support Vector Machine. The disease-based similarity measure is used for fertilizer recommendation
